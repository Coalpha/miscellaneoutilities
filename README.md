### Update at 2020.09.21:

This repo was made in "The Great Dotfiles Craze of Late 2018 till mid 2019" and was
intended to be used in a bunch of amazing shell scripts or something. I've really
got no idea anymore. Anyways, it'll probably see a revival when I can get my computer
actually organized again. For now, it's gonna go into @coarchive.
